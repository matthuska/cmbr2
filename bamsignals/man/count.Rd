\title{Count reads from a bam file.}
\usage{
count(gr, bampath, mapqual = 0, shift = 0, ss = F, paired.end = F,
  paired.end.midpoint = F, paired.end.max.frag.length = 1000, verbose = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{gr}{GenomicRanges object used to specify the regions}

\item{bampath}{path to the bam file storing the read. The file must be indexed.}

\item{mapqual}{discard reads with mapping quality strictly lower than this parameter.
The value 0 ensures that no read will be discarded, the value 254 that only reads
with the highest possible mapping quality will be considered.}

\item{shift}{shift the read position by a user-defined number of basepairs. This can
be handy in the analysis of chip-seq data.}

\item{ss}{produce a strand-specific count or ignore the strand of the read. Strand-specific counts
will be returned in a 2*length(gr) matrix.}

\item{paired.end}{a logical value indicating whether the bampath contains paired-end
sequencing output. In this case, only first reads in proper mapped pairs are considered
(FLAG 66).}

\item{paired.end.midpoint}{a logical value indicating whether the fragment middle
points of each fragment should be counted. Therefore it uses the tlen information from
the given bam file (MidPoint = fragment_start + int( abs(tlen) / 2) )). For even tlen,
the given midpoint is the round half down real midpoint.}

\item{paired.end.max.frag.length}{an integer indicating which fragments should be
considered in paired-end sequencing data. Default value of 1,000 bases is generally
a good pick.}
}
\value{
a vector or a matrix with the counts
}
\description{
Count reads in the bins specified by a GenomicRanges object.
A read position is always specified by its 5' end, so a read mapping to the reference strand
is positioned at its leftmost coordinate, a read mapping to the alternative strand
is positioned at its rightmost coordinate. To change that use the \code{shift} parameter.
